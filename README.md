# TaskFlow (Java Task Manager)

TaskFlow is a completed task management application written in plain Java.  
It implements core task logic and management functionality using Object-oriented design and Java collections.

This project was developed as a homework project during my backend training and showcases design of business logic and testable architecture.

## Tech Stack
- Java 8+
- Core Java OOP
- Collections (HashMap, Lists)
- Unit tests

## Features
- Add, update, and delete tasks
- Task statuses and management logic
- In-memory task storage using collections
- Unit tests demonstrating core functionality

## Project Structure
- `src/` — main application logic
- `test/` — test cases covering core functionality

## Project Status
Completed.  
This project demonstrates ability to design and implement business logic in Java.  
It can be extended later with a persistence layer and REST API.

## Future Enhancements
- Add RESTful API using Spring Boot
- Persist data using a database
- Implement web UI or API client
